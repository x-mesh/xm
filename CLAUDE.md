# x-kit

Claude Code plugin marketplace for structured multi-agent orchestration.

## Code Review Principles (x-review)

x-review agents must follow these principles when producing findings.

### Universal Principles (apply to all lenses)

1. **Context determines severity** — Same pattern varies by exposure scope, data sensitivity, call frequency. Ask: "Where does this run, with what data, how often?"
2. **No evidence, no finding** — Show "this code does X," not "this could do X." No traceable path in diff = not a finding.
3. **No fix direction, no finding** — If the Fix is "be careful," it is not actionable. Suggest a specific code change or don't report.
4. **Review only changed code** — Don't report pre-existing issues outside the diff. Exception: when a change worsens an existing problem.
5. **One finding, one problem** — Never bundle multiple issues into a single finding.
6. **When in doubt, downgrade** — Hesitating between severities? Choose lower. Over-reporting erodes trust faster than under-reporting.

### Per-Lens Principles

| Lens | Core Principles |
|------|----------------|
| security | Validate at trust boundaries only / Read as attacker — trace reachable paths / Recognize existing defense layers (ORM, framework escaping, auth middleware) |
| logic | Boundary + empty values cause 80% of bugs / Compare intent vs implementation in conditionals / Trace state mutation propagation |
| perf | Optimize only at measurable bottlenecks / I/O always trumps CPU / Show evidence, not speculation |
| tests | Verify behavior, not implementation / Riskier paths need tests more / False-confidence tests are worse than none |
| architecture | Blast radius = design quality measure / Abstractions only for current complexity (YAGNI) / Layers enforce dependency direction |
| docs | Code says "how," docs say "why" / Public API contracts must be explicit / False docs worse than no docs |
| errors | All failures must be visible / Recover or fail fast / Error info must be specific enough for caller to respond |

### Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria |
|----------|---------|
| Critical | Immediately exploitable security flaw, data loss/corruption, production outage |
| High | Feature defect, unhandled error path, severe perf degradation (10x+). No data loss. |
| Medium | Code quality issue, edge-case-only bug, incomplete test coverage |
| Low | Style, missing docs on internals, micro-optimization suggestions |

### Finding Quality Standard

Good finding: `[High] src/api.ts:42 — concrete description with traced path and context → Fix: specific code change`

Bad finding: `[Medium] src/api.ts:42 — vague description → Fix: fix it`

## Planning Principles (x-build)

x-build plan-phase agents must follow these principles.

### Universal Principles (apply to all plan activities)

1. **Decide what NOT to build first** — Scope is defined by exclusion. Every requirement added constrains every future one.
2. **Name the risk, then schedule it early** — Highest uncertainty goes first. Fail fast > fail late.
3. **A plan is a hypothesis, not a promise** — Design for adaptability: small tasks, clear boundaries, minimal cross-task deps.
4. **Intent over implementation** — PRD says WHAT/WHY. Tasks say WHAT to do. Neither prescribes HOW unless hard constraint.
5. **If you can't verify it, you can't ship it** — Every requirement needs success criteria. Every task needs done_criteria.
6. **Surface ambiguities before picking** — Multiple interpretations of the request? List them; never pick silently. The agent's job is to expose the fork, not choose for the user.
7. **Name low-confidence assumptions** — Assumptions at ≥ high confidence may stay implicit. Anything below must be written down (in PRD, plan, or AskUserQuestion) and validated before the next phase.

### PRD Quality — Good vs Bad

| Section | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Goal | One sentence, single focus | Multiple goals joined by "and" |
| Success Criteria | Measurable, binary pass/fail | "Should be fast and reliable" |
| Constraints | Non-negotiable hard limits | Preferences disguised as constraints |
| Risks | Likelihood + impact + mitigation | "Security risks" |
| Acceptance | Testable by command or state check | "Code is well-tested" |

### Consensus Agent Principles

| Agent | Core Principle |
|-------|---------------|
| architect | Simplest architecture that meets constraints wins |
| critic | The most dangerous assumption is the one nobody questioned |
| planner | If a task can't be one sentence starting with a verb, it's too big |
| security | Security requirements are constraints, not features |

### Critique Dimensions

| Dimension | Principle |
|-----------|-----------|
| Approach fitness | Simpler alternative exists → complex approach must justify itself |
| Risk ordering | Highest uncertainty first in schedule |
| Dependency structure | Maximize parallelism — no data dep = no declared dep |
| Missing tasks | Check every transition: setup→code→test→deploy |
| Done-criteria quality | Must be verifiable by command/state, not subjective |
| Scope creep | No R# traceability = scope creep |

## SKILL.md Authoring

### Language Rules

SKILL.md is a prompt for LLMs — write instructions in English for precision.

| Content type | Language |
|-------------|----------|
| Instructions, logic, rules, anti-patterns | **English only** |
| User-facing output examples (normal mode) | Korean OK |
| Term mapping tables (mode detection) | Korean OK |
| Section headers | English |
| Code examples | English |

**NEVER write instructions/rules in Korean.** Korean in SKILL.md is only for output templates shown to the user.

### Length Budget

**Hard limit: 500 lines per SKILL.md.** Longer files waste context on every invocation and get skimmed rather than read. If your skill exceeds 500 lines, split reference material into `docs/references/<plugin>-<topic>.md` and link from the main file. Current audit: `docs/skill-audit.md`.

### Required Sections

Every SKILL.md must include, in order: `Overview` → `When to Use` → `<Core Process>` → `Common Rationalizations` → `Red Flags` → `Verification`.

The **Common Rationalizations** table (excuses agents use to skip steps + factual rebuttals) is the single most impactful discipline mechanism — minimum 5 domain-specific rows. Without it, the skill has no defense against being partially applied.

## Documentation

- `README.md` (English) and `README.ko.md` (Korean) must stay in sync
- When editing README.md, always update the corresponding section in README.ko.md
- `/x-release` Step 3.6 enforces this automatically

## Testing

```bash
bun test                    # run all tests
bun test test/core          # run specific test file
```

## Model Routing

Use the cheapest model that gets the job done. For commands that just execute a script and return output, haiku is sufficient and ~78% cheaper than sonnet.

### Routing Rules

| Task type | Model | Examples |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Display/query** — run command, return output | **haiku** | `config show/set/get`, `version`, `update`, `agents list/match`, `status`, `task list`, `trace show/list`, `memory list/search` |
| **Interactive wizard** — needs AskUserQuestion | **sonnet** | `config` (interactive), `init`, `setup`, auto-route confirmation, pipeline orchestration |
| **Reasoning** — analysis, planning, orchestration | **sonnet** (escalate to **opus** when budget allows) | `plan`, `forecast`, `run`, strategy execution, code review, problem solving |

### How to Apply

For haiku-eligible commands, delegate via Agent tool:
```
Agent tool: { model: "haiku", description: "x-kit: [command]", prompt: "Run: [bash command]" }
```

### Principle

> If the output is determined by a script (not by LLM reasoning), use haiku.
> The model is a messenger, not a thinker — pay messenger rates.

### Guardrail

Never route to haiku if the task involves: analysis, code generation, review, planning, evaluation, or multi-step orchestration. If detected, warn and escalate to sonnet. See `x-kit/skills/x-kit/SKILL.md` Model Guardrail for full rules.

### Adaptive Model Routing (Cost Engine v2)

The cost engine learns from past outcomes and adjusts routing automatically. Model selection follows a 4-level priority chain:

```
model_overrides → model_learned → profile → fallback
```

| Priority | Source | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `model_overrides` | Explicit per-role config — always wins |
| 2 | `model_learned` | Learned from outcome feedback (≥5 samples, 90-day rolling window — hardcoded, separate from budget.window_hours) |
| 3 | profile | `economy` / `balanced` / `performance` setting |
| 4 | fallback | Hard-coded safe defaults |

**New config keys:**

| Key | Description | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| `model_learned` | Auto-populated by the engine from `task_complete` feedback; do not set manually | (auto-populated) |
| `budget.window_hours` | Rolling window for spend tracking (default: 24h) | `48` |
| `budget.projects` | Per-project budget caps | `{"my-project": {"max_usd": 2.0}}` |
| `strategies.escalate.quality_threshold` | Minimum quality score before escalating haiku→sonnet→opus (scale 1-10, default 7) | `7` |

**How adaptive routing works:** each `task_complete` event records `model`, `role`, `cost_usd`, `quality_score` (recorded for future use; current learner uses binary success signal), and a `correlation_id` (format: `ce-XXXXXXXX`). After MIN_SAMPLES=5 outcomes for a role, the engine promotes the best-performing model into `model_learned`. Routing decisions are linked to outcomes via correlation IDs for external tooling and future aggregation.

**Escalation cascade:** the `escalate` strategy uses `quality_threshold` to gate model promotion. If haiku's quality score falls below the threshold, the task re-runs at sonnet; if sonnet also falls short, it escalates to opus. Cost estimate is probability-weighted across all three tiers.

## Edit Policy

**NEVER edit files under `x-kit/skills/` directly.** That directory is the marketplace copy — a build artifact.

- Always edit the **source** SKILL.md in each plugin's own directory (e.g., `x-solver/skills/x-solver/SKILL.md`)
- The release process (`/x-release`) copies source → `x-kit/skills/`
- If you edit the marketplace copy, the change will be overwritten on next release and the source will remain stale

| Path | Role | Editable? |
|------|------|-----------|
| `x-solver/skills/x-solver/SKILL.md` | Source | **YES** |
| `x-kit/skills/x-solver/SKILL.md` | Marketplace copy | **NO** |

This applies to all plugins: x-build, x-op, x-probe, x-solver, x-eval, x-review, x-trace, x-memory, x-humble, x-ship, x-sync.

**Enforcement:** `.claude/hooks/block-marketplace-copy.mjs` is wired as a PreToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json` and will deny any Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit targeting a marketplace copy. If you see a block, follow the source path in the error message and re-run `scripts/sync-bundle.sh` when done. The hook mirrors the protected set from `scripts/sync-bundle.sh`, so keep them in lockstep when adding new synced files.

## Lessons (x-humble)
<!-- Section managed by x-humble. Manual editing allowed. -->
- STOP: Editing `x-kit/skills/` SKILL.md files directly. Always edit source directory first. (L4, confirmed 2 times, 2026-04-08)
- START: Before editing any SKILL.md, verify the file path is in the source directory, not marketplace copy. (L5, confirmed 2 times, 2026-04-08)
