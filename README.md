# x-kit

**"Build a REST API with JWT auth" → done.** Start a project with one sentence in Claude Code — it auto-decomposes tasks, runs agents, and verifies quality.

Multi-agent toolkit for Claude Code by [x-mesh](https://github.com/x-mesh). Zero dependencies.

## Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add x-mesh/x-kit
/plugin install x-kit@x-kit -s user
```

## Quick Start

```bash
/x-build plan "Build a REST API with JWT auth"
```

That single line:
1. Creates a project + auto-decomposes into tasks
2. Presents the task list for review (user approval)
3. Agents execute tasks in parallel
4. Quality verification + completion

Failed? Run `x-build run` again. Completed tasks are skipped, only remaining ones execute.

### Going deeper

```bash
# Full flow: requirements interview → PRD → consensus review → execution
/x-build init my-api
/x-build discuss --mode interview       # Gather requirements
/x-build plan "Build a REST API"        # PRD + task decomposition
/x-build prd-gate                       # Judge panel quality evaluation
/x-build run                            # Agent execution

# Strategic analysis
/x-op debate "REST vs GraphQL"          # Pro/con debate + verdict
/x-op review --target src/auth/         # Multi-perspective code review

# Retrospective
/x-humble reflect                       # Failure analysis + KEEP/STOP/START

# Quality measurement
/x-eval score output.md --rubric code-quality
```

### x-op — Strategy Orchestration

18 multi-agent strategies with self-scoring and auto-verification.

```bash
/x-op refine "Payment API design" --rounds 4 --verify
/x-op tournament "Best approach" --agents 6 --bracket double
/x-op debate "REST vs GraphQL"
/x-op investigate "Redis vs Memcached" --depth deep
/x-op compose "brainstorm | tournament | refine" --topic "v2 plan"
/x-op hypothesis "Memory leak cause" --rounds 3
```

### x-humble — Structured Retrospective

Learn from failures together. Not a rule generator — the retrospective process itself is the value.

```bash
/x-humble reflect              # Full session retrospective
/x-humble review "why scaffold?"  # Deep-dive on specific decision
/x-humble lessons              # View accumulated lessons
/x-humble apply L3             # Apply lesson to CLAUDE.md
```

```
CHECK-IN ──→ RECALL ──→ IDENTIFY ──→ ANALYZE ──→ ALTERNATIVE ──→ COMMIT
[accountability]  [summary]  [failures]   [root cause]  [steelman]    [KEEP/STOP/START]
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Phase 0 Check-In** | Verify previous COMMIT items before new retrospective |
| **Bias analysis** | 7 cognitive biases detected (anchoring, confirmation, sunk cost, ...) |
| **Cross-session patterns** | Recurring bias tags surfaced automatically |
| **Steelman Protocol** | User proposes alternative first, agent strengthens it |
| **Comfortable Challenger** | Agent challenges self-rationalization directly |
| **KEEP/STOP/START** | Lessons stored, optionally applied to CLAUDE.md |

---

### x-eval — Quality Evaluation

Multi-rubric scoring, strategy benchmarking, A/B comparison, and change measurement.

```bash
/x-eval score output.md --rubric code-quality     # Judge panel scoring
/x-eval compare old.md new.md --judges 5          # A/B comparison
/x-eval bench "Find bugs" --strategies "refine,debate,tournament"  # Benchmark
/x-eval diff --from abc1234 --quality              # Change measurement + quality delta
/x-eval rubric create strict --criteria "correctness,edge-cases"   # Custom rubric
```

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **score** | N judges score content against rubric (1-10, weighted avg, consensus σ) |
| **compare** | A/B comparison with position bias mitigation |
| **bench** | strategies × models × trials matrix with Score/$ optimization |
| **diff** | Git-based change analysis + optional before/after quality comparison |
| **rubric** | Create/list custom evaluation rubrics |
| **report** | Aggregated evaluation history |

**Built-in rubrics:** `code-quality`, `review-quality`, `plan-quality`, `general`
**Domain presets:** `api-design`, `frontend-design`, `data-pipeline`, `security-audit`, `architecture-review`
**Bias-aware judging:** High-confidence x-humble lessons (confirmed 3+) surfaced as optional judge context

---

### x-solver — Problem Solving

4 structured strategies with auto-recommendation.

```bash
/x-solver init "Memory leak in React component"
/x-solver classify          # Auto-recommend strategy
/x-solver solve             # Execute with agents
```

| Strategy | Pattern | Best for |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **decompose** | Break → solve leaves → merge | Complex multi-faceted problems |
| **iterate** | Hypothesis → test → refine loop | Bugs, debugging, root cause |
| **constrain** | Constraints → candidates → score → select | Design decisions, tradeoffs |
| **pipeline** | Auto-detect → route to best strategy | When unsure |

---

### x-agent — Agent Primitives & Teams

The foundation layer. Structured patterns on top of Claude Code's native Agent tool, plus hierarchical team management.

```bash
/x-agent fan-out "Find bugs in this code" --agents 5
/x-agent delegate security "Review src/auth.ts"
/x-agent broadcast "Review this PR" --roles "security,perf,logic"
/x-agent team create eng --template engineering
/x-agent team assign eng "Build payment system"
```

| Primitive | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **fan-out** | Same prompt → N agents in parallel |
| **delegate** | One prompt → one specialized agent |
| **broadcast** | Different role/context → each agent |
| **team** | Hierarchical team: Director → Team Leader → Members |

**Team system**: Define teams as YAML (`.xm/teams/`), assign goals, Team Leaders (opus) autonomously manage members using primitives. 5 templates: `engineering`, `design`, `review`, `research`, `fullstack`.

Model auto-routing: `architect` → opus, `executor` → sonnet, `scanner` → haiku. Override with `--model`.

## Quality & Learning Pipeline

x-kit connects x-build, x-op, x-eval, and x-humble into a closed feedback loop:

```
x-build plan → PRD Quality Gate (7.0+) → Consensus Review (4 agents)
     ↓
x-build tasks done-criteria → Acceptance contracts from PRD
     ↓
x-op strategy --verify → Judge Panel (bias-aware) → Auto-retry
     ↓
x-eval score → Per-task quality tracking → Project quality dashboard
     ↓
x-build verify-contracts → Done criteria fulfillment check
     ↓
x-humble reflect → Root cause + bias analysis → KEEP/STOP/START lessons
     ↓
lessons → CLAUDE.md + x-eval judge context → Next session applies patterns
```

| Component | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Self-Score** | Every x-op strategy auto-scores against mapped rubric |
| **--verify loop** | Judge panel (bias-aware) → fail → feedback → re-execute (max 2) |
| **PRD consensus** | architect + critic + planner + security must agree |
| **Acceptance contracts** | `done_criteria` auto-derived from PRD → injected into agents → verified at close |
| **Auto-handoff** | Phase transitions preserve decisions, discard exploration noise |
| **plan-check (9 dims)** | Includes tech-leakage: warns on undeclared technology names |
| **Quality dashboard** | `x-build status` shows per-task scores + project avg |
| **Domain rubrics** | 5 presets (api-design, frontend, data-pipeline, security, architecture) |
| **Bias-aware judging** | x-humble lessons (confirmed 3+) inform judge context |
| **x-eval diff** | Measure how skills changed + quality delta |
| **x-humble reflect** | Structured retrospective with bias detection + pattern tracking |

---

## Shared Config

```bash
/x-kit config set agent_max_count 10              # 10 agents parallel
/x-kit config set team_default_leader_model opus  # Team Leader model
/x-kit config set team_max_members 5              # Max members per team
/x-kit config show
```

Settings stored in `.xm/config.json` (project-level).

### How it works

```
SKILL.md (spec)  →  Claude (orchestrator)  →  Agent Tool (execution)
       ↕                      ↕
x-build CLI (state)  ←  tasks update (callback)
```

- **SKILL.md**: Orchestration spec that Claude reads. Defines plan→run flow, agent spawn patterns, error recovery.
- **x-build CLI**: State management layer. Persists tasks/phases/checkpoints as JSON in `.xm/build/`. Does not spawn agents directly.
- **Claude**: Interprets SKILL.md, spawns agents via Agent Tool, calls CLI callbacks on completion.
- **Persistent Server**: Bun HTTP server caches CLI calls for fast repeated responses. AsyncLocalStorage for per-request isolation.

## Requirements

- Claude Code (Node.js >= 18 bundled)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- No external dependencies
