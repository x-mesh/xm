# AskUserQuestion Dark-Theme Rule

Reference for plugins using AskUserQuestion. Sourced from x-build/skills/x-build/SKILL.md.

**CRITICAL:** The `question` field in AskUserQuestion is invisible on dark terminals.

**Visibility map:**
| Element | Visible | Use for |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `header` | ✅ YES | Short context tag (e.g., "x-op bump", "Pipeline") |
| `question` | ❌ NO | Keep minimal — user cannot see this text |
| option `label` | ✅ YES | Primary info — must be self-explanatory |
| option `description` | ✅ YES | Supplementary detail |

**Always follow this pattern:**
1. Output ALL context (descriptions, status, analysis) as **regular markdown text** BEFORE calling AskUserQuestion
2. `header`: put the key context here (visible, max 12 chars)
3. `question`: keep short, duplicate of header is fine (invisible to user)
4. Option `label` + `description`: carry all decision-relevant information

**WRONG:** Putting context in `question` field → user sees blank space above options
**RIGHT:** Print context as markdown first, use `header` for tag, options for detail
