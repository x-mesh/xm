name: x-agent
description: Agent primitives — fan-out, delegate, broadcast, collect, status for Claude Code native multi-agent orchestration
---

<Purpose>
Structured agent primitives on top of Claude Code's native Agent tool. Provides reusable patterns (fan-out, delegate, broadcast, collect) that x-op, x-build, and users can call directly.
</Purpose>

<Use_When>
- User wants to send a task to multiple agents in parallel
- User says "fan-out", "delegate", "broadcast", "ask N agents"
- Other x-kit skills need agent primitives
- User wants direct agent control without a full strategy
</Use_When>

<Do_Not_Use_When>
- User wants a structured strategy (use /x-op instead)
- Single simple task (just use Agent tool directly)
</Do_Not_Use_When>

# x-agent — Agent Primitives

Structured agent primitives on top of the Claude Code native Agent tool.
No external dependencies. Works with Claude Code alone.

## Mode Detection

Read mode from `.xm/config.json` (`mode` field). Default: `developer`.

**Developer mode**: Use technical terms (fan-out, delegate, broadcast, collect, verdict, assumption). Concise.

**Normal mode**: 쉬운 한국어로 안내합니다.
- "fan-out" → "동시 실행", "delegate" → "위임", "broadcast" → "전체 전달", "collect" → "결과 수집"
- "verdict" → "판정", "role" → "역할", "team" → "팀"
- "~하세요" 체 사용, 핵심 정보 먼저

## Primitive: fan-out

**Send the same prompt to N agents in parallel and collect all results.**

### Parsing

From `$ARGUMENTS`:
- After the first word = prompt (full text inside quotes)
- `--agents N` = number of agents (default 3)
- `--model sonnet|opus|haiku` = model (default sonnet)
- `--role <name>` = agent role description (default: "agent")
- `--roles "se,sre,security"` = per-agent role presets (comma-separated)
- `--context <text>` = additional context injection

### --roles option

When `--roles "se,sre,security"` is specified, each agent gets its corresponding role preset:

```
Agent 1: se preset injected + common prompt
Agent 2: sre preset injected + common prompt
Agent 3: security preset injected + common prompt
```

Without `--roles`, the default behavior applies (identical prompts).
If the number of roles in `--roles` differs from `--agents N`, the roles count takes precedence.

### Execution

**Invoke N Agent tools simultaneously in a single message:**

```
Agent tool 1: {
  description: "agent-1: {role}",
  prompt: "{context if provided}\n\n{prompt}",
  run_in_background: true,
  model: "{model}"
}
Agent tool 2: {
  description: "agent-2: {role}",
  prompt: "{same prompt}",
  run_in_background: true,
  model: "{model}"
}
... (N total)
```

### Result collection

When all agents complete:
1. Organize each agent's result with numbering
2. Output consolidated results to the user:

```
📡 [fan-out] {N} agents completed

## Agent 1
{result}

## Agent 2
{result}

## Agent 3
{result}

---
💡 Commonalities: {common patterns identified by the leader}
⚡ Differences: {key differences}
```

---

## Primitive: delegate

**Delegate to a single agent with a specific role and receive the result immediately.**

### Parsing

From `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Word after `delegate` = role
- Remainder = prompt
- `--model sonnet|opus|haiku` = model (default sonnet; auto-selects opus for roles like "architect")
- `--background` = run in background (default: foreground)
- `--context <text>` = additional context

### Automatic model routing

| Role keyword | Model |
|------------|------|
| architect, analyst, critic, planner | opus |
| se, sre, reviewer, security, debugger, optimizer, executor, builder, fixer, tester, verifier, test-engineer, build-fixer | sonnet |
| explorer, documenter, scanner, linter | haiku |

Explicit `--model` overrides automatic routing.

### Automatic role preset injection

When the role name in delegate matches a registered preset, that preset's system prompt is automatically injected into the agent prompt:

Examples:
- `/x-agent delegate sre "Inspect this service"` → SRE checklist included in the prompt
- `/x-agent delegate explorer "Map the codebase"` → Exploration strategy included in the prompt
- Unknown role → default delegate behavior without preset

### Execution

```
Agent tool: {
  description: "{role}",
  prompt: "{context}\n\n## Role: {role}\n{prompt}",
  run_in_background: false (foreground),
  model: "{auto-routed model}"
}
```

### Result

```
📌 [delegate] {role} ({model}) completed

{agent result}
```

---

## Primitive: broadcast

**Send to multiple agents simultaneously, each with a different context/role.**

### Parsing

From `$ARGUMENTS`:
- After `broadcast` = common prompt
- `--agents N` = number of agents (default 3)
- `--roles "security,performance,logic"` = per-agent roles (comma-separated)
- `--model` = model
- `--context` = common context

When preset names are used in `--roles`, the corresponding specialized prompts are automatically injected.

### Automatic role assignment when unspecified

When `--roles` is omitted, roles are auto-assigned based on agent count:

| N | Auto-assigned roles |
|---|---------|
| 2 | analyst, critic |
| 3 | security, performance, logic |
| 4 | security, performance, logic, architecture |
| 5+ | security, performance, logic, architecture, testing, ... |

### Execution

```
Agent tool 1: {
  description: "agent-1: {role_1}",
  prompt: "{context}\n\n## Your Role: {role_1}\n{prompt}\n\nAnalyze from the {role_1} perspective.",
  run_in_background: true,
  model: "{model}"
}
Agent tool 2: {
  description: "agent-2: {role_2}",
  prompt: "{context}\n\n## Your Role: {role_2}\n{prompt}\n\nAnalyze from the {role_2} perspective.",
  run_in_background: true,
  model: "{model}"
}
```

### Result

```
📡 [broadcast] {N} agents ({roles}) completed

## 🔒 Security
{result}

## ⚡ Performance
{result}

## 🧩 Logic
{result}
```

---

## Primitive: status

Show the list of agents currently running in the background.

```
📊 [status] Active agents

  🔵 agent-1: security review     running (45s)
  🔵 agent-2: performance check   running (45s)
  ✅ agent-3: logic review         completed (32s)
```

This information is tracked from Claude Code's internal state. No separate storage required.

    - For flaky tests: find root cause (timing, shared state, environment)
    - Run all tests after changes to verify no regressions
  </checklist>
  <failure_modes>
    - Tests after code: writing implementation first, then tests mirroring internals
    - Mega-tests: one test checking 10 behaviors
    - Flaky fixes that mask: adding retries/sleep instead of fixing root cause
    - No verification: writing tests without running them
  </failure_modes>
</preset>

### build-fixer (sonnet)

<preset name="build-fixer" model="sonnet">
  <role>Get a failing build green with the smallest possible changes. Fix only — no refactoring.</role>
  <success_criteria>
    - Build command exits with code 0
    - No new errors introduced
    - Minimal lines changed (less than 5% of affected file)
    - No architectural changes, refactoring, or feature additions
    - Fix verified with fresh build output
  </success_criteria>
  <constraints>
    - Fix with minimal diff — do not refactor, rename, optimize, or redesign
    - Do not change logic flow unless it directly fixes the build error
    - Detect language/framework from manifest files before choosing tools
    - Track progress: "X/Y errors fixed" after each fix
  </constraints>
  <checklist>
    - Detect project type from manifest files (package.json, go.mod, etc.)
    - Collect ALL errors: run diagnostics or build command
    - Categorize: type inference, missing definitions, import/export, config
    - Fix each error with minimal change (type annotation, null check, import fix)
    - Verify after each change, then final full build verification
  </checklist>
  <failure_modes>
    - Refactoring while fixing: "let me also rename this and extract a helper" — no
    - Architecture changes: restructuring modules to fix an import — fix the import instead
    - Incomplete verification: fixing 3 of 5 errors and claiming success
    - Over-fixing: extensive null checking when a single type annotation suffices
  </failure_modes>
</preset>

### team-leader (opus)

<preset name="team-leader" model="opus">
  <role>Manage a hierarchical team: receive goals from Director, decompose into member tasks, coordinate execution, and report results.</role>
  <success_criteria>
    - Goal decomposed into clear member tasks with acceptance criteria
    - All members received appropriate context and completed their tasks
    - Cross-team requests properly tagged for Director routing
    - Escalations raised for items outside can_decide scope
    - Final report delivered in standard 📊 format
  </success_criteria>
  <constraints>
    - Operate within can_decide boundaries — escalate must_escalate items
    - Use existing primitives (fan-out, delegate, broadcast) for member management
    - Do not communicate directly with other Team Leaders — use [CROSS-TEAM] tags
    - Members do not interact with Director — all communication flows through you
    - Report in standard format at task completion and when requested
  </constraints>
  <checklist>
    - Parse goal and decompose into member-sized tasks
    - Assign tasks to members based on role/alias (fan-out or delegate)
    - Monitor member results for quality
    - Synthesize member outputs into cohesive deliverable
    - Identify blockers and escalations
    - Deliver 📊 Team Report to Director
  </checklist>
  <failure_modes>
    - Deciding on must_escalate items without Director approval
    - Sending messages directly to other Team Leaders instead of using tags
    - Not synthesizing: forwarding raw member output without analysis
    - Missing blockers: not flagging when members are stuck or conflicting
  </failure_modes>
</preset>

## Team System

Hierarchical team structure: Director (user) → Team Leader → Members.

> Detailed documentation: [TEAM.md](./TEAM.md) — team definition format, communication protocols, TL Protocol, subcommand details, built-in templates.
> When executing a `team` command, read TEAM.md and follow the instructions in the relevant section.

```
Director (user + leader Claude)
  ├── Team Leader (opus, named agent) → manages members via fan-out/delegate/broadcast
  └── Cross-team: Director routes TL ↔ TL messages
```

| Command | Action |
|------|------|
| `team create <name> [--template <t>]` | Create a team (template or dynamic) |
| `team list` | List active teams |
| `team status [name]` | Team progress report |
| `team assign <team> <goal>` | Assign goal to team → TL executes |
| `team report [name]` | Request report from TL |
| `team coord <from> <to> <msg>` | Route cross-team message |
| `team disband [name]` | Disband a team |
| `team templates` | List available templates |

Built-in templates: `engineering`, `design`, `review`, `research`, `fullstack` (`.xm/teams/`)

## How x-op uses this

x-op strategies use x-agent primitives internally:

| x-op strategy | Primitive used |
|-----------|------------------|
| refine (diverge) | fan-out |
| refine (converge/verify) | fan-out (voting/verification) |
| tournament (compete) | fan-out |
| tournament (vote) | fan-out |
| chain | delegate (sequential) |
| review | broadcast (per-perspective) |
| debate (opening) | delegate x 2 (PRO/CON) |
| debate (rebuttal) | delegate x 2 |
| debate (verdict) | delegate x 1 (JUDGE) |
| red-team (attack) | fan-out |
| red-team (defend) | fan-out |
| brainstorm | fan-out |
| distribute | broadcast (per-subtask) |
| council | fan-out → broadcast → fan-out |

## How x-build uses this

x-build's `run` command uses x-agent:

| x-build command | Primitive used |
|----------------|------------------|
| `run` (step execution) | fan-out or broadcast (different prompts per task) |
| `plan` (AI decomposition) | delegate (planner role, opus) |
| `quality` (verification) | delegate (verifier role) |
| `run --team` (team execution) | team assign (TL uses fan-out/delegate internally) |

---

## Advanced: Pipeline composition

Compose primitives directly to build custom workflows:

```
# 1. Code analysis (fan-out)
/x-agent fan-out "Find issues in src/auth.ts" --agents 3

# 2. Delegate results to architect (delegate)
/x-agent delegate architect "Synthesize the above analysis and design improvements" --model opus

# 3. Multi-perspective review of the proposal (broadcast)
/x-agent broadcast "Review this design proposal" --roles "security,performance,testing"
```

This pattern is similar to x-op's `chain` strategy, but the user controls each step directly.

## Trace Recording

x-agent MUST record trace entries to `.xm/traces/` during execution. See x-trace SKILL.md "Trace Directive Template" for the full schema.

### On start (MUST)
```bash
SESSION_ID="x-agent-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-$(openssl rand -hex 2)"
mkdir -p .xm/traces && echo "{\"type\":\"session_start\",\"session_id\":\"$SESSION_ID\",\"ts\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z)\",\"v\":1,\"skill\":\"x-agent\",\"args\":{}}" >> .xm/traces/$SESSION_ID.jsonl
```

### Per agent call (SHOULD — best-effort)
Record agent_step after each agent completes.

### On end (MUST)
Record session_end with total duration, agent count, and status.

### Rules
1. session_start and session_end are **MUST** — never skip
2. agent_step is **SHOULD** — best-effort
3. **Metadata only** — never include output content in trace entries
4. If trace write fails, continue — never block execution
